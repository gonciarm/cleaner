# File cleaner

Super simple to use tool that helps organize files in the directory. Must have for people that store everything in downloads  folder.

Just copy the script file (cleaner.py) into the messy directory and run the script form the console (tested on Windows machine). After the cleanup log file (cleanerLog_[date].txt) will be created containing summary of cleaning process.
